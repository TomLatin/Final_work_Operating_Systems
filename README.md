Welcome to my READ ME, this project was done as part of an operating systems course at Ariel University and this is the final assignment of the course.
The task deals with the following topics: signals, CPU scheduling, files in Linux and the memory structure of a program in C language.
For each topic there is a question with sections. 
Each question is in a separate folder within the repository and in each folder there is another README file for the programming parts.
